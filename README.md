# Get_and_Clean_Data_Project_Coursera

This is the project of Coursera: Get and Clean Data. The R code run_analysis.R does the following:

1. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
2. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
3. Read, manipulate and determine the data training and test sets.
4. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
5. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
6. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
7. Save the tidy data set as tidy_data.txt
